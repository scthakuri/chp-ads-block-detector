Block Ads Blocker Extensions and Increase your revenue by using Ads Blocker Detector Plugin

== Description ==

Adblocking extensions are most used to block the ads shown in browsers or websites. Nowadays, Adblock Plus is a popular extension to block ads in browsers. This will decrease the revenue of the blog owner.

Now, We have introduced the WordPress plugin (**CHP Ads Block Detector WordPress Plugin**) that will detect most of the AdBlock extensions installed on the browser and show a popup to disable the extension. This plugin restricts the user to access the page unless the user will disable the extension for your website.

This will work for most of the ads block extension such as Adblock, AdBlock Plus, ghostery, etc.

This plugin will also works for opera built-in ads block extension.

> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />
> We have remove the Image Request from the plugin. So, Some of the extension may not be detected. If you found any extension that is not detecting then create a ticket on our website.
> In case of any issue with the plugin, Please visit the [Documentation](https://chpadblock.com/docs/support/) page.
> Most of the users faced issue with the uBlock extension. To fix this issue, Please visit [Documentation page to fix for uBlock Extension](https://chpadblock.com/docs/support/not-working-with-ublock-extension/).
